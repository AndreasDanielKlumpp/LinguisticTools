et_xmlfile
et_xmlfile is a low memory library for creating large XML files. It is based upon the xmlfile module from lxml <http://lxml.de/api.html#incremental-xml-generation>_ with the aim of allowing code to be developed that will work with both libraries. It was developed initially for the openpyxl project but is now a standalone module. The code was written by Elias Rabel as part of the Python Duesseldorf <http://pyddf.de>_ openpyxl sprint in September 2014. Version: 1.0.1. License: MIT.
